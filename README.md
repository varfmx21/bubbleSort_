# Bubble Sort Algorithm

## Description
In this activity, we will explore the functionality of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm, one of the simplest yet fundamental sorting methods in computer science. The goal of **Bubble Sort** is to sort a list of elements by comparing adjacent element pairs and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

## What do I need to do?

### 1. Understand the basic logic
The **Bubble Sort** algorithm compares and swaps consecutive elements in multiple passes through the list until all elements are sorted.

### 2. Implement the algorithm
Implement the **Bubble Sort** algorithm in a programming language of your choice. Below is an example implementation in C++:
